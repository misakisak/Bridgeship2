# Bridgeship2

Bridgeship is 

"You there, who's thinking 'I want to do something'!

Just thinking won't change the world!!

Let's become someone who takes action using Bridgeship.

Do you want to share your thoughts with others?

Do you want to find like-minded companions and take action?

Do you want to think about what you dislike, what you like, and what you want to do?

Do you want to know what you can do right now?

If that's you, you're already a worthy crew member of Bridgeship!

Now, let's embark on a journey together to change the world.

Bridgeship sets sail!"
